🎮 Game Rules
# Tic-Tac-Toe
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the grid.
The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
If the grid is filled without any player winning, the game is a draw.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Players choose one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
If both players choose the same option, it's a draw.
